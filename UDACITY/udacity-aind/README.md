### [Sudoku Solver](/sudoku)

In this lesson, you'll get taste of the power of Artificial Intelligence by developing an algorithm to solve every Sudoku puzzle. We won't go particularly in depth into the techniques yet, which we'll do in future lessons. For now, enjoy the fun of building your first AI agent and get coding!

### [Build A Game-Playing Agent (Isolation)](/isolation)

In this lesson, you'll build a Game-Playing agent that defeats opponents in Isolation. Along the way, you'll learn about advanced Game-Playing techniques such as Iterative Deepening, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Expectimax.
